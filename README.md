# Overview

This project is part of my assignment for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), where I'm building a webpage. The assignment involves creating a webpage to showcase various recipes. I will keep updating the website and make it look better as I learn more.

# Credits for the recipes
https://www.allrecipes.com

# Disclaimer
I don't have the rights to use the Images and Recipes that I'm using for this project, I feel that it okay to do so as this is simply a personal project and I don't intend to make money off of it.

However, if you find your work here and want it taken down, please email me at "krishangnayanbhagawati@gmail.com" and I will make the necessary changes.

I will also update this Readme to include proper credits for the recipes and images when I get the the time.
